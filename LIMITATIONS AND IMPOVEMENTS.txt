
Limitations:







Image Resolution:

The model uses a relatively simple architecture and is trained on low-resolution (28x28) images. It may struggle with more complex tasks or higher-resolution images.
Limited Complexity:

The model architecture is straightforward and may not capture intricate patterns in fashion items. More complex architectures like deep convolutional networks might yield better results.
Overfitting Risk:

With a limited amount of data, there's a risk of overfitting, especially when training for more epochs. Regularization techniques or data augmentation could be employed to mitigate this.
Class Imbalance:

The dataset might have imbalances across different classes, leading the model to be biased towards more prevalent classes.










Potential Improvements:






Advanced Architectures:

Implementing more sophisticated architectures like ResNet, Inception, or DenseNet could improve the model's ability to capture intricate patterns and features.
Transfer Learning:

Leveraging pre-trained models on larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and fine-tuning them for fashion classification might improve performance.
Data Augmentation:

Applying data augmentation techniques during training, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, can enhance the model's ability to generalize to variations in input data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experimenting with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) might lead to improved convergence and overall performance.
Ensemble Learning:

Combining predictions from multiple models (ensemble learning) can often lead to better generalization and robustness.
Class Balancing:

Addressing class imbalances in the dataset through oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during training can improve the model's ability to handle all classes equally.
Higher Resolution Images:

If available, training on higher-resolution images may enable the model to capture more intricate details in fashion items.
Explorative Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducting in-depth explorative data analysis to understand class distributions, data characteristics, and potential biases can guide improvements in preprocessing and model design.
Regularization Techniques:

Applying dropout or other regularization techniques can prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalization ability.
Learning Rate Schedulers:

Implementing learning rate schedulers can dynamically adjust the learning rate during training, potentially leading to better convergence.
